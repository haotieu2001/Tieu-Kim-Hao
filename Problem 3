# Troubleshooting High Memory Usage on a VM Running NGINX Load Balancer

When a VM running an NGINX load balancer consistently shows 99% memory usage, itâ€™s critical to diagnose the root cause and resolve it promptly to avoid service degradation or outages. Below are the steps to troubleshoot the issue, potential causes, impacts, and recovery steps.

## Step 1: Verify Memory Usage
### Check System Memory Usage:
Use `htop`, `top`, or `free -h` to confirm memory usage.
Look for processes consuming excessive memory.

#### Example:
```bash
free -h
top
```

### Check NGINX Memory Usage:
Use `ps` or `htop` to check NGINX processes.

#### Example:
```bash
ps aux | grep nginx
```

## Step 2: Analyze NGINX Configuration
### Review NGINX Configuration:
Check `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` and any included configuration files for misconfigurations.
Look for:
- High `worker_connections` or `worker_processes`.
- Large buffer sizes (`proxy_buffer_size`, `client_body_buffer_size`, etc.).
- Excessive caching configurations.

### Check for Open File Descriptors:
Use `lsof` to check if NGINX is holding too many open connections.

#### Example:
```bash
lsof -p <nginx_process_id>
```

## Step 3: Check for Traffic Spikes
### Analyze Access Logs:
Check `/var/log/nginx/access.log` for unusual traffic patterns (e.g., DDoS attacks, excessive requests).
Use tools like `awk`, `grep`, or log analyzers (e.g., GoAccess) to identify high traffic sources.

### Monitor Active Connections:
Use `netstat` or `ss` to check active connections.

#### Example:
```bash
netstat -anp | grep nginx
```

## Step 4: Check for Memory Leaks
### Inspect NGINX Version:
Ensure NGINX is up-to-date, as older versions may have memory leaks.

#### Example:
```bash
nginx -v
```

### Monitor Memory Over Time:
Use `vmstat` or `sar` to monitor memory usage trends.

#### Example:
```bash
vmstat 1
```

## Step 5: Check System-Level Issues
### Inspect Kernel and System Logs:
Check `/var/log/syslog` or `dmesg` for kernel-level memory issues.

#### Example:
```bash
dmesg | grep -i memory
```

### Check for Swapping:
Use `swapon -s` or `vmstat` to check if the system is swapping excessively.

#### Example:
```bash
swapon -s
```

## Potential Root Causes, Impacts, and Recovery Steps

### 1. NGINX Misconfiguration
- **Cause:** High `worker_processes`, `worker_connections`, or large buffer sizes.
- **Impact:** Excessive memory allocation, leading to high memory usage.
- **Recovery:**
  - Optimize NGINX configuration.
  - Reduce `worker_processes` or `worker_connections`.
  - Adjust buffer sizes based on traffic patterns.

### 2. Traffic Spikes or DDoS Attacks
- **Cause:** Sudden increase in traffic overwhelming the server.
- **Impact:** High memory usage due to increased connections and requests.
- **Recovery:**
  - Implement rate limiting in NGINX.
  - Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) or CDN to filter malicious traffic.
  - Scale horizontally by adding more VMs.

### 3. Memory Leak in NGINX
- **Cause:** Bug in NGINX or its modules causing memory to not be released.
- **Impact:** Gradual increase in memory usage until the system runs out of memory.
- **Recovery:**
  - Upgrade NGINX to the latest stable version.
  - Restart NGINX to temporarily free up memory.
  - Identify and disable problematic modules.

### 4. System-Level Memory Issues
- **Cause:** Kernel bugs or excessive swapping.
- **Impact:** System instability and degraded performance.
- **Recovery:**
  - Update the kernel to the latest version.
  - Reduce swap usage by optimizing memory settings.
  - Reboot the VM if necessary.

### 5. Other Processes Consuming Memory
- **Cause:** Unrelated processes (e.g., backups, cron jobs) consuming memory.
- **Impact:** Reduced memory available for NGINX.
- **Recovery:**
  - Identify and terminate unnecessary processes.
  - Schedule resource-intensive tasks during off-peak hours.

## Step 6: Implement Long-Term Fixes
### Optimize NGINX Configuration:
- Tune `worker_processes`, `worker_connections`, and buffer sizes.
- Enable caching for static content.

### Scale Infrastructure:
- Add more VMs and distribute traffic using a load balancer.
- Use auto-scaling to handle traffic spikes.

### Monitor and Alert:
- Set up monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track memory usage.
- Configure alerts for high memory usage or traffic spikes.
