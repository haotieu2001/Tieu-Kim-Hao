# Designing a Highly Available Trading System on AWS

## Introduction
Building a highly available, scalable, and cost-effective trading system requires a robust cloud architecture. This document outlines the design of a trading system inspired by Binance, leveraging AWS services to ensure resilience, high performance, and security while meeting the constraints of 500 requests per second throughput and a p99 response time of under 100 milliseconds.

## Architecture
### Overview of AWS Services and Alternatives Considered
Below is a breakdown of why each AWS service was chosen and the alternatives that were considered.

### 1️⃣ Route 53 (DNS Management)
✅ **Why Use It?**
- Provides global DNS resolution with low-latency routing.
- Supports failover routing for high availability.
- Integrates well with CloudFront, Load Balancers, and EKS.

🔄 **Alternatives Considered:**
- **Cloudflare DNS** → Faster resolution and additional DDoS protection, but less AWS integration.
- **Google Cloud DNS** → Good for multi-cloud but lacks deep AWS integration.

### 2️⃣ CloudFront + S3 (Static Frontend Hosting)
✅ **Why Use It?**
- CloudFront caches assets globally, reducing origin load.
- S3 provides cost-effective, scalable static hosting.
- Supports HTTPS via ACM (SSL/TLS certificates).

🔄 **Alternatives Considered:**
- **Amazon EC2 + Nginx** → More control but requires maintenance.
- **Vercel or Netlify** → Great for frontend hosting but less AWS infrastructure control.

### 3️⃣ ACM (SSL/TLS Certificates)
✅ **Why Use It?**
- Automated certificate provisioning & renewal.
- Integrated with CloudFront, ALB, and API Gateway.
- Free SSL/TLS certificates for AWS services.

🔄 **Alternatives Considered:**
- **Let's Encrypt + Certbot** → Free but requires manual renewal if not automated.
- **Cloudflare SSL** → Automatic HTTPS but not tightly integrated with AWS.

### 4️⃣ EKS (Kubernetes for Backend Services)
✅ **Why Use It?**
- Manages containerized services (User, Trading, Order Matching) efficiently.
- Auto-scaling via HPA ensures high availability.
- Multi-AZ deployment increases fault tolerance.

🔄 **Alternatives Considered:**
- **EC2 + Docker Swarm** → More control but lacks managed scaling.
- **AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service)** → Easier than EKS but less flexible.
- **Lambda (Serverless)** → Harder for stateful workloads like order matching.

### 5️⃣ RDS (PostgreSQL for Persistent Trading Data)
✅ **Why Use It?**
- Managed PostgreSQL with backups, high availability, and replication.
- Read replicas for scaling read-heavy workloads.
- Multi-AZ deployments ensure data redundancy.

🔄 **Alternatives Considered:**
- **Aurora PostgreSQL** → Better scalability but higher cost.
- **Self-managed PostgreSQL on EC2** → More control but increased maintenance.

### 6️⃣ AWS ElastiCache (Redis for User Sessions & Trading Data Caching)
✅ **Why Use It?**
- Ultra-fast reads/writes for user sessions and pre-cached market data.
- Reduces RDS load, improving performance.
- Multi-AZ replication ensures high availability.

🔄 **Alternatives Considered:**
- **Memcached** → Simple key-value store but lacks persistence.
- **DynamoDB** → Works for caching but has higher latency than Redis.

### 7️⃣ AWS SQS (Message Queue for Order Matching)
✅ **Why Use It?**
- Asynchronous processing of high-throughput trade orders.
- FIFO queues guarantee message order and exactly-once processing.
- Decouples services, preventing trading system overload.

🔄 **Alternatives Considered:**
- **Kafka on EC2** → More powerful but requires more operational effort.
- **Amazon Kinesis** → Better for real-time event streaming but higher complexity.

### 8️⃣ AWS KMS + Secrets Manager (Database Security)
✅ **Why Use It?**
- AWS KMS encrypts sensitive trading data (user balances, order history).
- AWS Secrets Manager securely manages database credentials & API keys.

🔄 **Alternatives Considered:**
- **HashiCorp Vault** → Great for multi-cloud but harder AWS integration.
- **SSM Parameter Store** → Cheaper than Secrets Manager but less feature-rich.

## Scaling Strategies
### 1️⃣ Frontend Scaling (CloudFront + S3)
✅ **Current Setup:**
- AWS CloudFront caches static assets.
- AWS S3 hosts the frontend.

✅ **Scaling Plan:**
- Enable aggressive caching for API responses.
- Use Lambda@Edge for lightweight processing at edge locations.
- Deploy S3 buckets in multiple regions with cross-region replication (CRR).

### 2️⃣ Backend Scaling (EKS Cluster)
✅ **Current Setup:**
- EKS runs User, Trading, and Order Matching Services.

✅ **Scaling Plan:**
- **Kubernetes HPA:** Scale up pods based on CPU, memory, or request load.
- **Cluster Autoscaler:** Automatically add worker nodes when needed.
- **Use Spot & On-Demand Instances:** Spot for batch jobs, on-demand for latency-sensitive workloads.
- **Optimize Networking:** Deploy services across multiple AZs.

### 3️⃣ Database Scaling (RDS PostgreSQL)
✅ **Current Setup:**
- RDS PostgreSQL stores trading data and transactions.

✅ **Scaling Plan:**
- **Read Replicas:** Handle reporting and analytics workloads.
- **Partitioning & Sharding:** Partition order/trade data by time.
- **Aurora PostgreSQL Migration:** If scaling demands increase.

### 4️⃣ Caching Layer Scaling (AWS ElastiCache - Redis)
✅ **Current Setup:**
- ElastiCache (Redis) is used for session storage, user profiles, and trading data caching.

✅ **Scaling Plan:**
- Deploy Redis with multi-AZ replication.
- Enable Read Replicas.
- Implement TTL for stale data removal.

### 5️⃣ Asynchronous Processing Scaling (AWS SQS for Order Matching)
✅ **Current Setup:**
- AWS SQS queues trade orders for processing.

✅ **Scaling Plan:**
- Use **SQS FIFO Queues** for consistency.
- Auto-scale consumer workers based on queue length.
- Use **AWS EventBridge** for event-driven processing.

### 6️⃣ Observability & Monitoring Scaling
✅ **Monitoring Setup:**
- AWS CloudWatch Metrics + Prometheus + Grafana for real-time monitoring.
- **Distributed Tracing:** Use AWS X-Ray or OpenTelemetry.
- **Log Aggregation:** Use AWS OpenSearch or Loki.

## Conclusion
This architecture ensures that the trading system is highly available, scalable, and secure while maintaining a p99 response time of under 100ms. Future scalability plans include:
- Multi-region failover strategies.
- Kubernetes multi-cluster deployment for geographical distribution.
- Advanced AI-based anomaly detection for trading security.

By leveraging AWS services effectively, this design provides a solid foundation for handling high-throughput trading workloads.
